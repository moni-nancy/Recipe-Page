    <h2>About The Food</h2>
    <p>Another classic of Roman cuisine, this is a pasta dish prepared with a fiery hot sauce made with tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and red chili peppers.As the Italian word arrabbiata literally means angry,this meal is often mistranslated as angry pasta- the name, in fact, refers to the pasta's intense, spicy sauce, which packs such a punch that it can easily make you red in the face.In the absence of penne, ziti rigati or rigatoni can also be used. Even though it is traditionally enjoyed as an entr√©e or primo piatto, this simple, yet flavorful pasta recipe certainly holds its own as more than a mere prelude to the main course.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>To begin, heat a tablespoon of olive oil on a low heat in a pan and gently soften the minced garlic. Take care, as this won't take long at all and you don't want any colour on the garlic or it will impart a bitter flavour into the sauce</li>
  <li>Add the chilli flakes to the oil, temper for 10 seconds, then add the tin of tomatoes</li>
  <li>Cook down over a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes until the sauce has thickened. Taste and add salt and a chicken bouillon</li>
  <li>Cook the penne in a pan of heavily salted boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes or as per packet instruction</li>
  <li>Once the pasta is cooked al dente, drain and add it to the sauce, tossing to make sure the pasta is evenly coated</li>
  <li>Serve straight away and garnish with torn basil</li>
</ol>
